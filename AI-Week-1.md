# AI-Week-1
  Q1 : There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborate on the artificial intelligence in your eyes.
  + In my eyes, artificial intelligence is understood as any 1 machine that possesses AI, it is capable of operating almost the same as a human.


  Q2 : Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?
  + The relationship between them is Artificial intelligence is the broader picture including machine learning and deep learning, machine learning is part of artificial intelligence and deep learning is a component of machine learning
  + The similarities is creating smart intelligent machines. 
  + The different is 
    - Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that deals with automating intelligent machine behaviors. This is the process of transmitting data, information and simulating human thought and learning processes to machines. The main goal of AI is to create machines that can think and act like humans on their own. This machine is also capable of processing large amounts of data at a faster rate than a human. 
    - Machine Learning is a term that refers to the actions you teach a computer to improve a task it is performing. Specifically, the ability of Machine Learning is to use algorithms to analyze available information, then learn and make decisions and predictions about relevant things.
    - This concept is inspired by the function of human brain cells called neurons. Deep Learning uses an artificial neural network to analyze data in various details with algorithms that simulate the human nervous system, along with performing learning from a large amount of data. Data is provided to solve specific problems. Similar to how we learn from experience, a Deep Learning algorithm will perform a task multiple times, each time tweaking the task slightly to improve the result.


  Q3 : After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.
  + Virtual Assisstant : Apple Siri is an example of a Narrow AI that operates with a limited pre-defined range of functions. Siri often has problems with tasks outside its breadth of abilities. 

Q4: Which chip is for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors. Please brief these four major modules.
  + The chip designed specifically for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors is the Ascend Neural Processing Unit (NPU)
  + The Ascend NPU is composed of four major modules:
  1. The memory module of the Ascend Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is responsible for storing the data required for neural network computations.
  2. The computing module of the Ascend Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is responsible for carrying out the matrix multiplication and activation functions that are core to neural network computations.
  3. The control module of the Ascend Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is responsible for managing the flow of data and instructions between different parts of the NPU, as well as coordinating the interaction between the NPU and the host processor.
  4. The communication module of the Ascend Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is responsible for enabling the NPU to communicate with other components in the system, such as external memory or other processors.


Q5 : Based on your current knowledge and understanding, please elaborate on the development trends of artificial intelligence in the future in your view.
  + With the development of AI, there have been practical applications of AI in handling tasks that companies and enterprises are struggling with. In the future, AI will be a tool to help humans actualize tasks that are still unresolved today.
