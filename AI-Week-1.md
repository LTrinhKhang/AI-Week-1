  Q1 : There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborate on the artificial intelligence in your eyes.
  + In my eyes, artificial intelligence is understood as any 1 machine that possesses AI, it is capable of operating almost the same as a human.


  Q2 : Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?
  + The relationship between them is Artificial intelligence is the broader picture including machine learning and deep learning, machine learning is part of artificial intelligence and deep learning is a component of machine learning
  + The similarities is creating smart intelligent machines. 
  + The different is 
    - Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that deals with automating intelligent machine behaviors. This is the process of transmitting data, information and simulating human thought and learning processes to machines. The main goal of AI is to create machines that can think and act like humans on their own. This machine is also capable of processing large amounts of data at a faster rate than a human. 
    - Machine Learning is a term that refers to the actions you teach a computer to improve a task it is performing. Specifically, the ability of Machine Learning is to use algorithms to analyze available information, then learn and make decisions and predictions about relevant things.
    - This concept is inspired by the function of human brain cells called neurons. Deep Learning uses an artificial neural network to analyze data in various details with algorithms that simulate the human nervous system, along with performing learning from a large amount of data. Data is provided to solve specific problems. Similar to how we learn from experience, a Deep Learning algorithm will perform a task multiple times, each time tweaking the task slightly to improve the result.


  Q3 : After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.
